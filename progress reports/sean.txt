Progress report


24.3.27
Cloned branch for personal developing.
Created Food class to track macronutrients.

24.4.3
Designed cage for scale and magic box for the RPi (potato)

24.4.5
Upgraded cage and box

24.4.12
Rescaled cage and box to fit within Tech's 3d printing parameters

24.4.17
Tried to 3d print the stuff, but learned we needed more filament.
The filament I brought from home was 1.75mm, but we needed 2.85mm/3mm.

24.4.22
Reassigned to work on the scale and weight calculation instead
of the text analysis. ~~kill me~~

24.4.24
Ordered new filament

24.4.29
Attempted to assemble scale using Arduino, and started working towards
sending info from the adruino to the potato. Keyword "attempted"; it did
not go well at all.

The scale circuit was constructed at this time.

24.5.1
